      Please note that different states have different guidelines for the
      re-registration for the vehicles which is coming from other states. So,
      before applying for NOC for car or NOC for bike gather information about
      the rules for the re-registration of vehicles in the state where you want
      to move your vehicle. Like in Delhi NCR only Euro-4 compliant vehicle can
      be registered.

    <h2>3 W’S YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT NOC</h2>

    <ul class="table-noc">
      <li class="first-noc">
        <p class="uppercase">WHAT IS NOC ?</p>
        <p class="text-small">
          NOC stands for No Objection Certificate. It is a legal document which
          is issued from the regional RTO in case of re-registration of a
          vehicle from one state or union territory to any other or even
          inter-state. This is as per regulations that you are required to apply
          for a change of address and re-register when you are going to another
          state for over a year. The major reason behind this is for keeping
          track of vehicles and for quick actions in case of any situation in a
          particular territory. Updating the records will ease the process
          mainly for security purposes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="uppercase">WHO NEEDS IT ?</p>
        <p class="text-small">
          Change of place of residence . New residence is in the jurisdiction of
          some other RTO Selling the vehicle to a person who resides in some
          other RTO area.<br /><br />
          The original purpose for applying a new NOC is to permit a change of
          the local government authority jurisdiction on that vehicle from one
          state to the other state’s or inter-state Thelying a new NOC
          jurisdiction.<br />
          A vehicle owner, who is about to change its RTO from one state to
          another permanently, should apply for it.
        </p>

        <p class="uppercase">WHY YOU NEED IT ?</p>
        <p class="text-small">
          The original purpose for applying a new NOC is to permit a change of
          the local government authority jurisdiction on that vehicle from one
          state to the other state’s or inter-state jurisdiction. In simple
          words, if you shifting your vehicle because of either change of
          residence or you are selling to someone who lives in other RTO
          jurisdiction , then there will be change of address/ change of
          ownership. This NOC or no objection certificate is issued by parent
          RTO certifying that there is no traffic chalan, crime or dues is
          pending against the vehicle.
